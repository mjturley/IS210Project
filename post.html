                        <h2>The Early Years</h2>
                        <p>I spent my childhood in the suburbs of Salt Lake County Utah and my teenage years in North West Arkansas. I took challenging courses at Bentonville West High School including AP Language and Composition and AP Calculus 1. In addition
                            to these more academically rigorous courses, I had the opportunity to participate in the High School's Chamber Orchestra and to explore creating visual arts in the various art courses offered.</p>
                        <p>I often attended church weekly and engaged with the associated youth activites. These youth activities encouraged the young men and women to develop their talents and use them to serve the community.
                            These activities sometimes resulted in helping a regional high school with cleaning up the agricultural area or simply creating freezer meals for community members who were in hard times.</p>
                        <p>In addition to community service, I was able to serve in my church congregation a handful of times by playing the organ. During my teenage years, I gained an interest in the dying art of organ performance. I began
                            taking lessons to learn about this beautiful instrument and I developed enough skills to play simple organ works. These works enabled me to provide musical accompaniment. </p>
                        <h2>Present Times</h2>
                        <p> After high school, I began pursuing higher education at Brigham Young University. I am currently preparing to apply to the accounting major. Over the past two years, I have taken classes that have stretched me.
                            I have taken classes about music, music history, religion, accounting, literature, and most recently a plethora of basic business classes. These include but are not limited to, finance and information systems.    </p>
    
                        <h2>Goals for Work</h2>
                        <p>I hope to become a valued member of a team where learning and growth are prioritized. Additionally, I hope to use the skills I know to help my team members
                            and to help clients with their needs.  </p>
